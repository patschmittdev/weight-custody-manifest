# Release model weights only to an attested runtime

WCM is an open, pre-1.0 specification that binds encrypted weights to a signed
release policy, so a key broker releases the decryption key only to a workload
whose attestation matches the manifest.

!!! tip "TL;DR"
    The reference SDK ([weight-custody-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/weight-custody-manifest/)
    0.28.2, Apache-2.0) runs its conformance vectors offline with no GPU or cloud
    account, and verifies AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX and NVIDIA H100 CC evidence
    captured on real hardware. Against an operator who physically owns the
    machine, WCM offers accountability, not cryptographic custody, because
    published memory-bus attacks defeat current confidential-computing silicon.

    ---

    `wcm conformance` runs every level offline. The quote vectors use synthetic
    certificate roots.

-   __What it proves, and what it does not__

    ---

    What an operator who owns the hardware can still do, and why a valid
    signature cannot tell an authorized key from an extracted one.

    [Limitations](limitations.md)

-   __Hardware evidence__

    ---

    AMD SEV-SNP (Azure), Intel TDX (GCP) and NVIDIA H100 CC, each with a
    committed fixture that verifies offline. H100 landed in
    [#54](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/pull/54).

    Next: [Agent Manifest](https://manifest.agentrust-io.com) records the agent
    that loads the weights. Check a real TDX quote yourself at

!!! warning "Pre-1.0, design under review"
    This is a design under review, not a production standard. Do not rely on it
    for production.

## The trust direction

When a frontier model is deployed into a customer's own infrastructure (on-prem,
sovereign cloud, air-gapped), the party at risk flips: it is now the **model
builder** whose weights are exposed to the customer's hardware and operators. WCM
is the protocol for that direction: a signed manifest describing which weights
are released and under what terms, attestation-gated key release into a verified
enclave, wipe-on-lapse and revocation, and a chain of custody for derivatives.

WCM answers one question: can a model builder release encrypted weights only to
an approved workload, keep that approval short-lived, and retain evidence of what
happened? The answer is yes for the reference protocol and its software checks,
with one boundary stated plainly rather than buried, in the next section.

WCM composes with [OpenSSF Model Signing](oms-interoperability.md) rather than
competing with it: OMS proves which model artifact a signer published; WCM
governs whether the key for those exact bytes may be released to a freshly
attested workload and how long that workload may retain it.

## Honest guarantee scope

WCM names two guarantees and never blends them:

- **Cryptographic custody** against software and remote adversaries.
- **Accountability-grade** protection against an operator who physically owns the
  hardware, *not* cryptographic custody. Cheap published memory-bus attacks
  ([TEE.fail](https://tee.fail/), [BadRAM](https://badram.eu/)) defeat current
  confidential-computing silicon; there WCM offers cost, detection, containment,
  legal recourse, and a mandatory physical-hardening tier.

See [Limitations](limitations.md) and the specification's §3.6.

| Against | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Local software demo** | Checks the reference protocol in an ordinary process. The operator can inspect its memory. Mock attestation provides no hardware-rooted confidentiality. |
| **Protected runtime** | Requires verified platform evidence, trusted keys, channel binding, workload isolation, and enforced renewal. Platform configuration, firmware, side channels, and the serving application's export paths affect the result. |
| **Physical hardware owner** | Do not assume weight extraction is impossible. Published physical attacks motivate additional hardening and operator assumptions. A valid signature alone cannot distinguish an authorized key from an extracted one. |

The [RAND weight-security report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2849-1.html)
provides threat-model context; it is not a certification of WCM. Passing the
reference suite does not assign a deployment an attacker-resistance tier.

## What is checked today

The reference implementation ships **92 portable conformance vectors**: 32 at L1,
38 at L2, 12 at L3, and 10 at L4. Run them yourself with `wcm conformance`.

This is the reference implementation's self-test, not independent certification
and not a hardware deployment test. CPU quote vectors use synthetic certificate
roots, GPU cryptographic verification is not covered by them, and the runner
prints its uncovered cases. See [Schema and conformance](conformance.md).

## Try it

Python 3.11+ and Git. No cloud account, GPU, model download, or API key. Keep WCM
in its own environment, because other AgenTrust packages may require a different
`cryptography` version.

```bash
python -m venv .venv-wcm
# bash: source .venv-wcm/bin/activate
# PowerShell: .venv-wcm\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install weight-custody-manifest
wcm conformance
```

Then run the closed-weight allow/deny example, which supplies an approved serving
measurement and then changes it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentrust-io/demos
cd demos
python demo-07-closed-weight/run.py
```

Expected: joint signature `True`, approved release `True`, then unapproved release
`False`, because the measurement is not in `accepted_measurements`. Both cases use
synthetic attestation and a placeholder key; labels such as "enclave" in the output
do not mean hardware was used. [Getting started](getting-started.md) covers the SDK
in full.

## Where it fits

- **Sovereign deployment.** Run a closed model inside nationally controlled
  infrastructure while making weight release conditional on an approved, attested
  workload.
- **Enterprise and air-gapped.** Deliver encrypted weights to customer-operated
  environments without turning a one-time handoff into permanent authorization.
- **Regulated model delivery.** Carry signed policy, release decisions, renewal
  state, revocation, and derivative lineage as portable evidence.

## Get involved

WCM is pre-1.0 and the review is open. Four routes in:

- **Model owners.** Pressure-test the release policy against your actual threat model.
- **Runtime and cloud teams.** Add or review an attestation profile and prove what
  your protected boundary can support. Start with
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Security researchers.** Challenge the threat model, fixtures, hardware
  assumptions, and explicit non-goals. Reporting process in
  [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Standards contributors.** Review the manifest, portable evidence, conformance
  levels, and interoperability boundaries.

The specification, schema, conformance suite, reference SDK, threat model, and
reference key-release service are available under Apache-2.0. Vendors may build
interoperable hosted services and protected-runtime implementations. Public
availability does not establish production readiness.
